        <p>
          What place, if any, do fully autonomous lethal weapons have on the battlefield? What can and should be done to minimize the risks they present?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          For centuries, humans have used technical breakthroughs as means of improving their odds in warfare. From wooden spears to .50 caliber machine guns, the way we wage war has already seen great changes; how will computers affect warfare? The Information Age quickly digitalized our aircraft, ships, weapons, and communications, but the advancement of artificial intelligence may change the way we use these tools all together.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the idea of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more of a reality than science fiction, governments are beginning to research, develop, and utilize AI in war and on the battlefield. In particular, the world has been discussing the autonomy of weapon systems. There are three degrees of autonomy when we talk about autonomous weapon systems: in-the-loop, on-the-loop, out-of-the-loop.

                <h4>Drones</h4>
                <p>
                  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones, like this MQ-9 Reaper have single handedly changed the way governments collect intelligence and deploy airstrikes. They have been in use since the creation of the Gnat, renamed the Predator, in 1995, and are now an integral tool used in most missions. Today, the US Air Force has more pilots training to fly UAVs than manned aircraft. <a href="http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4779" target="_blank">(Defense.gov)</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Drones like these are capable of autonomous flight and surveillance, but require human input to launch missiles. They are currently one of the most widely used and discussed autonomous weapon system.

                <h4>Utility Robots</h4>
                <p>

Robots like these have some autonomous functions, like patrolling and righting themselves, and are used for surveillance, inspection, and bomb disposal. Any critical movements require remote input from a human.

                <p>
                  Fire-and-forget missiles like this FGM-148 require a human to lock on to a target and then fire, the missile then autonomously guides itself to the target even if it was launched from an area that was not in line-of-light of the target.

                <h4>Optimus Prime</h4>
                <p>
                  While Optimus Prime is a fictional character, he is a good representation of what people are considering when thinking about the future of AI on the battlefield. Optimus can reason, make decisions, and attack on his own, just as a fully autonomous weapon system may be able to do at some point. This is the type of weapon systems that is being considered as countries discuss the use of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS).

          The idea of utilizing artificial intelligence on the battlefield brings up a host of ethical and political questions. What place, if any, do fully autonomous lethal weapons have on the battlefield? Is it right for a machine to make the “kill decision” on its own? What can and should be done to minimize the risks they present?
