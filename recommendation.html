      <h1>Policy Recommendation: Regulate, but Continue to Develop</h1>
      <p class="lead">While the issue of autonomous weapons is contentious, under either a utilitarian or deontological framework, the development of autonomous weapons by the United States and its allies should continue, with a strong international organization to regulate and research the technologies instituted.</p>
      <p class="lead">Regardless of humanity's best intentions, it is naive to believe that autonomous weapons will not continue to be developed - despite the UN Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and Ban on Chemical Weapons, these technologies were developed by bad actors and have put the world in grave danger. The United States' military supremacy is tantamount to global security, and as the premise of an Iran or North Korea with vastly technologically superior autonomous weapons would completely upend this military advantage it is critical for the US and its allies to continue to develop autonomous weapons.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">With this development occurring however, a strong international-facing body should be created by the United States to set global precedent on the use of these weapons, share research on autonomous weapons with our allies to ensure higher standards of their use and to improve the technologies and maintain ethical standards in their use. This body should include a group of experts in artificial intelligence who can accurately and independently assess the technologies and interpret this to the public to keep them informed and so that adequate national discussion can occur if their use becomes unethical. By centering the body on the United States as opposed to the UN, the US can align its interests in military capability with the global interest in ensuring that autonomous weapons are used appropriately and that their safety is maximized and that they are not used by threats to global society.</p>
